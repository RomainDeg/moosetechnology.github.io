This page aims to present different queries one might want to perform when analyzing a model.
It can be used as a baseline for further analysis.

We present how to perform the queries in a playground or with the visual tool proposed by Moose.

## Queries

### Find entity

#### Class with a specific name

Using the [*Queries Browser*]({{ site.baseurl }}/moose-wiki/Users/moose-ide/browsers#queries-browser): first, we request all the classes of a model.

![Query All Classes](./img/class-with-name-getClasses.png){: .img-fill .img-center }

Then, we create a subquery that selects the class using their name.

![Select by name](./img/select-name.png){: .img-fill .img-center }

Finally, you can select the entity in the bottom panel.

It is also possible to perform the query in an inspector or playground.
The shortest way to find a class with a name is to use the `detect` method.

```st
classes := model allWithType: FamixStClass.
withPrefix := classes detect: [ :class | class name = #'MyClassName' ].
```

#### Classes with their name beginning with or ending with

When performing queries, it is often useful to start with a substep of classes by looking at their names.
This can be done easily using the `beginWith:` and the `endWith` methods.

```st
classes := model allWithType: FamixStClass.
withPrefix := classes select: [ :class | class name beginsWith: #'MyPrefix' ].

withSuffix := classes select: [ :class | class name endsWith: #'MySuffix' ]
```

### God classes

[God classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object) are classes that *knows too much* or *does too much*.
One way to find god classes is to count the number of lines or the number of methods of a class.

Using the [*Queries Browser*]({{ site.baseurl }}/moose-wiki/Users/moose-ide/browsers#queries-browser), one can use the Numeric Query on the classes of a model.

![Numeric Query](./img/query-properties-god-classes.png){: .img-fill .img-center }

Using a playground, one can perform a query on a model to retrieve the god classes by numbers of lines:

```st
model allModelClasses select: [ :each | each numberOfLinesOfCode > 150 ]
```

Or by numbers of methods:

```st
model allModelClasses select: [ :each | each numberOfMethods > 50 ]
```

### God cyclomatic complexity

The [cyclomatic complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity) presents the complexity of a program.
It basically corresponds to the number of possible branches in a method.
The less cyclomatic complexity for a method, the better it is.

The following script sorts the methods extracted in a model by their cyclomatic complexity.

```st
((self model allBehaviourals)
    collect: [ :entity | entity -> entity cyclomaticComplexity ]
    thenSelect: [ :assoc | assoc value > 3 ]) asOrderedCollection sort: #value descending
```

### Deprecated methods

Deprecated methods are methods existing in the current version of an application, and that will disappear in the next version.
Such a method should not be used.

In Java, it is possible to retrieve the deprecated methods by searching the method with the `@Deprecated` annotation.

```st
model allModelMethods
    select: [ :t | 
        t annotationInstances notEmpty
            and: [ t annotationTypes anySatisfy: [ :a | a name = 'Deprecated' ] ] ]
```

### Dead methods

Dead methods are methods that are not invoked by any other methods.

> Be careful; some methods might not be directly called but are referenced thanks to abstraction or are dedicated to be extended by another application.
> It is often the case when dealing with a framework.

```st
model allModelMethods
    collect: [ :method | method -> method incomingInvocations ]
    thenSelect: [ :assoc | assoc value isEmpty ]) asOrderedCollection
```

### Application tests

```st
^ (model allModelMethods
    select: [ :t | 
        t annotationInstances notEmpty
            and: [ t annotationTypes anySatisfy: [ :annotation | annotation name endsWith: 'Test' ] ] ])
    asOrderedCollection flattened
```

## Visualizations

### Class hierarchy

The class hierarchy presents the classes of a model with their hierarchy links (*e.g.* superclass, subclasses, ...).
It also includes the methods and attributes of each class.

![Moose 9 version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Moose-9-%23aac9ff.svg){: .no-lightense }

The easiest way to visualize a class hierarchy is to use the [*UML browser*]({{ site.baseurl }}/moose-wiki/Users/moose-ide/browsers#uml-browser).

It is also possible to script one UML visualisation of Roassal.


```st
builder := RSUMLClassBuilder new.
classes := mooseModel allModelClasses.
builder modelDescriptor
        instVars: [ :aFamixClass | aFamixClass attributes ];
        instVarSelector: [:aFamixAttribute | aFamixAttribute name];
        methods: [ :aFamixClass | aFamixClass methods];
        methodSelector: [:aFamixMethod | aFamixMethod name].

builder classes: classes.
builder build.
builder canvas @ RSHierarchyPacker.
builder canvas
```

### Packages cycles

![Moose 8 version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Moose-8-%23aac9ff.svg){: .no-lightense }

```st
tarjan := MalTarjan new.
tarjan nodes: model allModelNamespaces.
tarjan edges: model allModelNamespaces from: #yourself toAll: [ :a | a allProvidersAtScope: FamixTNamespace ].
tarjan run.
tarjan inspect
```

### Meta-model UML

It is possible to visualize the meta-model with a class hierarchy.

![Moose 9 version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Moose-9-%23aac9ff.svg){: .no-lightense }

```st
builder := RSUMLClassBuilder new.

classes := FamixJavaModel metamodel classes.

builder modelDescriptor
        instVars: [ :metaDescription | metaDescription primitiveProperties ];
        instVarSelector: [:metaDescription | metaDescription implementingSelector];
        methods: [ :metaDescription | metaDescription complexProperties];
        methodSelector: [:metaDescription | metaDescription implementingSelector].

builder classes: classes.

builder build.
builder canvas @ RSHierarchyPacker.
builder canvas
```

A better solution to explore a meta-model is to use the [*Meta Browser*]({{ site.baseurl }}/moose-wiki/Users/moose-ide/browsers#meta-browser) that provides a detailed view on every important aspects of a meta-model.
